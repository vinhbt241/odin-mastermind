To play the game, thou need to click this link and click Run: https://replit.com/@vinhbt241/odin-mastermind#mastermind.rb  

There is 2 mode in this game:  

Code Breaker (B): Thou shall become a brave hero, on the journey to break the code created by evil Machine Lord.  
Code Maker (M): Thou shall become a Lord yourself, with power to create unbreakable code to make those lowly machines struggle.  

To create or break code, you will need to have powerful gem stones with ability to resonate with each other and create ultimate power to break/create the code. These gem stones are:  
"black" : Very mysterious  
"white" : Not so much mysterious  
"red" : Know as R, often come with 2 other gems stone and become RGB brothers (lol)  
"green" : eh, like above  
"blue" : Thou must have guess it, this gem stone and the 2 above is brothers  
"yellow" : In other games, this gem must be very valuable, but this game don't use money, so meh  
To use the power of gem stones, thou just need to call their name (or type to be exact?)

The rule is complicated, so check out Wiki page for more info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)
